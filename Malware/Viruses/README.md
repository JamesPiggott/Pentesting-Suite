# Viruses

This part of the repo is just for educational purposes only. The viruses used may be dangerous to your system and others and their use may be illegal in your jurisdiction.

The purpose of this repository on viruses is to test anti-virus (AV) detection, to build defenses against viruses and to provide a taxonomy for those eager to know more.

In particular there is an example code of a computer virus that relies on polymorphic code (self-mutating code) instead of polymorphic encryption like before.
