# Ultimate Guide To Advanced Hacking

This repository contains the text, images, drawings and code associated with my book 'Ultimate Guide to Advanced Hacking', the title is perhaps a bit of an exaggeration, but it builds on my many years of expertise in the field of Cybersecurity.
You can generate your own copy of the book by following the steps as described below. There is also a standalone companion book 'Black Team Field Manual' which contains just the commands associated with each of the topics. Finally, there is the book 'Linux, Programming & Hacking' which was my first book published in 2015. It is an easy-going introductory book so if you are new to these topics I suggest you start there.
