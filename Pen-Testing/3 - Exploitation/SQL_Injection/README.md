# SQL Injection

With SQL Injection we are exploiting the ability to manipulate the query that will evaluate if a given username and password is correct. As an example a typical URL query might look like:

SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '' + UserInput AND Password = '' + PassInput;

Here UserInput and PassInput are the input that will be checked with the one stored on the database. But we can manipulate the URL to always evaluate the query to true. For both username and password use the following strings:

' OR ''1=1'.
