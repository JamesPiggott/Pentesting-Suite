# Dark Web

The term Dark Web still holds quite a bit of a mystery to most people. Supposedly, a super-secret place on the internet is only accessible with secret codes and passwords where users can buy drugs, guns, assassins for hire and illegal sexual material. That description is mostly correct, but oversimplified.

The Dark Web comes in many forms, but simplest to understand are so called .onion sites only accessible through Tor Browser. As you may already know, onion routing sends your data encrypted through several proxies, basically other users, so nobody can track the data packets. You can access any legal website using Tor, but you can also access hidden websites that are potentially illegal known as .onion sites. These sites will have a name, but their address is usually a long string of random alphanumeric characters.

The first port of call after installing Tor Browser is The Hidden Wiki. As the name implies, it is a list of Dark Web sites, some of which may lead you to objectionable material.

A more legitimate destination is a so-called secure drop organized by the British newspaper The Guardian. Here whistleblowers can safely deposit information without fear of being identified or tracked. This is in fact what the original purpose of onion routing was supposed to be when it was first developed at DARPA. It was to allow US agents to safely communicate with their intelligence agencies.

Of course other newspapers have followed The Guardian example. Here are a few:

## Dark Side of the Dark Web
While the Dark Web offers a place for investigative journalists, whistleblowers and protesters to safely communicate there is of course also an evil side. Anything that is illegal in most countries has been driven underground into marketplaces. The Dark Web is filled with forums in which people can purchase drugs, fake IDs, weapons, credit cards (carding), rent-a-hackers and even hit-men. Though the latter is supposedly completely infiltrated by law enforcement. I am not going to give a breakdown of where to find these marketplaces and how to purchase their wears (crypto of course). I will only list those underground forums related to hacking or more generally cybersecurity. Plenty of legitimate companies actively keep track of Dark Web news to give their customers early warning. I want to give an indication on how that is performed, so you can manually do the same and potentially create your own automated tools.

If you want to know more about the nefarious marketplaces and the role of the not-so anonymous cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin then I highly recommend the book Tracers In The Dark by Andy Greenberg.
