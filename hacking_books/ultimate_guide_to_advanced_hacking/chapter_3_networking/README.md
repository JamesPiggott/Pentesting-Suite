# Chapter 3 Networking

In this chapter we finally delve into connecting computers, arguably a very basic ingredient of hacking or cybersecurity (which ever way you want to use this text).

Our knowledge of operating systems, especially Linux will be invaluable. That does not mean Windows form Microsoft is not, but we will be performing our operations mostly from a Linux machine. Windows, arguably, remains an important target. As such commands we learned in chapter 1. Linux Administration will be making a return. Often used in support of tools and procedures that we want to carry out. That said, this chapter will also feature a fair degree of background information. It is a requirements to first understand how IP addresses work when discussing networks basics. The same goes for radio frequencies when discussing Wi-FI and Rf networks. 

## Networking Basics

You know what an IP address looks like. 123.123.123.123. Each of the four elements can have a value between 0 and 255, for 256 values. In 0s and 1s this range can be covered by 8 bits. So 00000000 is 0 and 11111111 equals 255. IPv4 thus has an address range that is 32 bits long, with a total of over 4 billion values. No doubt you will already know most of this. In networking parlance each of the 8-bits sections is referred to as an octet.
